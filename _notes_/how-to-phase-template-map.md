# 🧪 Rick Assistant ZSH Plugin - Phase/Template Mapping Reference

Comprehensive mapping that aligns each implementation phase and component with the appropriate template categories from the Prompt Template System. This structured reference will serve as implementation compass throughout the development process.

## 📊 Key Benefits

This mapping provides several critical advantages for your AI-driven development workflow:

- **📌 Precision-targeted template selection** for each implementation task
- **🔍 Elimination of decision fatigue** during development
- **⚡ Accelerated implementation velocity** through optimal prompt selection
- **🔄 Systematic approach** to complex component development

## 🔹 How to Use This Reference

For each implemented component we will:

1. **Locate the specific component** in the phase/template mapping
2. **Identify the recommended template categories** for that component
3. **Select the appropriate template** from the Prompt Template System
4. **Customize the template** with component-specific parameters
5. **Generate implementation** with Copilot

## 🔹 Implementation Strategy Optimization

The mapping reveals optimal phase-specific template strategies:

- **Phase 1 (Core Foundation)**: Focus on File Creation and Error Recovery templates
- **Phase 2 (ZSH Integration)**: Prioritize Command Processor and Terminal Compatibility templates
- **Phase 3 (UI & Experience)**: Leverage Menu System and UI Enhancement templates
- **Phase 4 (Command Safety)**: Utilize Dangerous Command and Bug Fix templates
- **Phase 5 (Expanded Features)**: Implement with Rick Personality and Feature Extension templates
- **Phase 6 (AI Integration)**: Focus on AI Integration and Error Recovery templates
- **Phase 7 (Advanced Features)**: Apply Performance Optimization and Bug Fix templates

The artifact provides a detailed component-by-component template mapping along with a phase-based template selection matrix to guide your implementation process with maximum efficiency.
