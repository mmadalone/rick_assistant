## üîß Alternative Prompt Strategies

If the standard templates don't yield desired results, try these alternative approaches:

### Step-By-Step Implementation Strategy

```
Create a [COMPONENT_NAME] module for a Rick Sanchez-themed ZSH assistant by following these exact steps:

STEP 1: Create these import statements:
- Import [MODULE_1] for [PURPOSE]
- Import [MODULE_2] for [PURPOSE]
- Import [MODULE_3] for [PURPOSE]

STEP 2: Define these constants:
- [CONSTANT_1] = [VALUE] # [PURPOSE]
- [CONSTANT_2] = [VALUE] # [PURPOSE]
- [CONSTANT_3] = [VALUE] # [PURPOSE]

STEP 3: Implement this main function:
def [FUNCTION_NAME](param1, param2, ...):
    """
    [FUNCTION_DESCRIPTION]
    
    Args:
        param1: [DESCRIPTION]
        param2: [DESCRIPTION]
    
    Returns:
        [RETURN_DESCRIPTION]
    """
    # Implement function body here
    
STEP 4: Add these helper functions:
- [HELPER_1]: [PURPOSE]
- [HELPER_2]: [PURPOSE]
- [HELPER_3]: [PURPOSE]

STEP 5: Add error handling for all functions:
- Use try/except blocks
- Add specific error types
- Include fallback behavior
- Add error logging

STEP 6: Create these Rick-themed messages:
- [MESSAGE_1]: [CONTEXT]
- [MESSAGE_2]: [CONTEXT]
- [MESSAGE_3]: [CONTEXT]

STEP 7: Add a main execution block:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Test code here
```

### Function-Based Implementation Strategy

```
Create a [COMPONENT_NAME] module for a Rick Sanchez-themed ZSH assistant with these specific functions:

FUNCTION 1: [FUNCTION_NAME](param1, param2)
PURPOSE: [DESCRIPTION]
IMPLEMENTATION:
- First check [CONDITION]
- Then perform [ACTION]
- Handle [EDGE_CASE]
- Return [RESULT]
ERROR HANDLING:
- Catch [ERROR_TYPE] and [ACTION]
- Ensure [SAFETY_FEATURE]

FUNCTION 2: [FUNCTION_NAME](param1, param2)
PURPOSE: [DESCRIPTION]
IMPLEMENTATION:
- First check [CONDITION]
- Then perform [ACTION]
- Handle [EDGE_CASE]
- Return [RESULT]
ERROR HANDLING:
- Catch [ERROR_TYPE] and [ACTION]
- Ensure [SAFETY_FEATURE]

FUNCTION 3: [FUNCTION_NAME](param1, param2)
PURPOSE: [DESCRIPTION]
IMPLEMENTATION:
- First check [CONDITION]
- Then perform [ACTION]
- Handle [EDGE_CASE]
- Return [RESULT]
ERROR HANDLING:
- Catch [ERROR_TYPE] and [ACTION]
- Ensure [SAFETY_FEATURE]

Also add Rick-themed messages and proper docstrings throughout.
```

### Example-Driven Implementation Strategy

```
Create a [COMPONENT_NAME] module for a Rick Sanchez-themed ZSH assistant based on these usage examples:

EXAMPLE 1:
```python
# Import the module
from src.module import function_name

# Use the primary function
result = function_name('input_parameter')

# Expected output:
# "I'm processing your garbage input, *burp* genius. Result: XYZ"
```

EXAMPLE 2:
```python
# Error handling example
try:
    result = risky_function('bad_input')
except SomeError as e:
    # Should output: "You really screwed that up, didn't you? Error: [error details]"
    handle_error(e)
```

EXAMPLE 3:
```python
# Configuration example
config = {
    'setting1': True,
    'setting2': 'value',
    'sass_level': 8
}
result = configured_function('input', config)
# Should configure behavior based on settings
```

Implement the module to make these examples work as shown.
Add proper error handling, docstrings, and Rick's personality.
```

## üìã Template Customization Guide

### Key Placeholders to Replace

- `[COMPONENT_NAME]`: The specific component to create/modify
- `[FEATURE_NAME]`: A specific feature to implement
- `[FUNCTION_NAME]`: Name of a function to create
- `[DESCRIPTION]`: Detailed explanation of purpose/behavior
- `[PARAMETER]`: Function parameter or input value
- `[RETURN_VALUE]`: What a function should return
- `[ERROR_TYPE]`: Specific error to handle
- `[ACTION]`: Specific action to take
- `[CONDITION]`: Condition to check

### Template Modification Tips

1. **Be specific**: The more specific your template, the better Copilot's output
2. **Provide examples**: Include example code for critical functionality
3. **Specify error handling**: Explicitly describe how errors should be managed
4. **Include personality**: Mention Rick's personality elements for consistency
5. **Prioritize features**: List the most important functionality first

### When Copilot Struggles

If Copilot's implementation is unsatisfactory:

1. **Try again** with the same prompt (results can vary)
2. **Be more specific** about the exact implementation details
3. **Break down** complex components into smaller prompts
4. **Provide examples** of desired functionality
5. **Use alternative templates** from different sections
6. **Combine multiple templates** for complex components
