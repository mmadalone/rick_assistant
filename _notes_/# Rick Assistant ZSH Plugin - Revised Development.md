   - Helps automate validation and ensures completeness.

2. **Dependency Management & Installation Flow**
   - Added a **setup script and dependency handling** step in early phases.
   - Ensures smooth installation of external tools like `ffmpeg`, `mediainfo`, and OpenAI API access.

3. **Explicit Performance Metrics**
   - Defined **performance targets** for response times, memory usage, and prompt rendering.
   - Helps track optimizations more effectively.

4. **Failover Testing Strategy**
   - Structured tests for **handling API failures and AI fallbacks**.
   - Added recovery testing for failure scenarios.
