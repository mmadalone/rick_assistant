🔹 Tweaked Prompt for Claude 3.7 Thinking
Deeply analyze and refactor the following **Zsh Bot plugin code** while ensuring **existing features, outputs, and user behavior remain 100% untouched**.

🚨 **STRICT REQUIREMENTS** 🚨
- **DO NOT break compatibility** with existing commands, outputs, or behavior.
- **DO NOT introduce regressions, unintended format changes, or broken interactions.**
- **DO NOT remove or alter existing functionality unless explicitly stated.**

✅ **Refactor with a focus on**:
- **Deep analysis of potential inconsistencies** across the codebase.
- **Maintain modularity & reuse logic** in well-structured functions/classes.
- **Preserve async behavior and ensure event loops remain stable.**
- **Follow best practices for Zsh plugin development** while keeping it Pythonic.
- **Improve error handling** (`try/except`) with meaningful error messages.
- **Apply PEP 8 formatting, type hints, and PEP 257-compliant docstrings.**
- **Optimize imports & remove redundant code**.
- **Ensure all user configurations, settings, and optional parameters work as expected.**

⚠ **First, analyze and verify that any changes will not break existing functionality.**
Then, provide a **brief summary of what was improved and why**.


Deep scan and refactor the following codebase while ensuring existing features and output remain **100% untouched**. 

🚨 **VERY IMPORTANT** 🚨:
- **DO NOT** modify existing functionality, outputs, or return values.
- **DO NOT** introduce new bugs, break existing logic, or change expected behavior.

✅ **Refactor with these principles**:
- **Keep readability, maintainability, and efficiency in mind**. Apply Pythonic best practices.
- **Preserve all existing tests and expected outputs**.
- **Structure reusable logic** into functions or classes where appropriate.
- **Avoid circular dependencies** or overly complex logic.
- **Simplify deep nesting**, redundant conditions, and loops where possible.
- **Apply structured error handling** (`try/except`) with clear, informative messages.
- **Ensure PEP 8 & PEP 257 compliance** (type hints, docstrings, formatting).
- **Optimize imports** and use built-in functions where applicable.

⚠ **Before making changes, analyze the code to confirm the modifications do not break functionality.**


🔹 When to Use It As-Is:
✅ Refactoring: When asking Copilot or Claude to clean up, optimize, or improve maintainability of existing plugin code.
✅ Ensuring No Breakages: When modifying internals but keeping expected behavior the same.
✅ Improving Readability & Structure: When restructuring code for better maintainability while preserving functionality.

⚠ When to Tweak It:
❌ Adding New Features → You’ll need to adjust the prompt to allow new functionality while keeping existing behavior stable.
❌ Changing Core Logic → If the plugin's behavior must change, clarify what should remain untouched vs. what should be modified.
❌ Debugging → If you're troubleshooting, replace “DO NOT modify functionality” with “Fix only the issue without altering unrelated behavior.”

🔹 Plugin-Specific Version (Optimized for Zsh Bot Development)
Analyze and refactor the following **Zsh Bot plugin code** while ensuring **existing features, outputs, and behavior remain 100% untouched**.

🚨 **STRICT REQUIREMENTS** 🚨
- **DO NOT break compatibility with existing commands or responses.**
- **DO NOT change expected user input/output formatting.**
- **DO NOT introduce breaking changes that affect Zsh integration or async behavior.**

✅ **Refactor with these principles**:
- **Maintain modularity & reuse logic** in well-structured functions/classes.
- **Ensure async behavior remains functional where applicable.**
- **Follow best practices for Zsh plugin development** while keeping it Pythonic.
- **Use structured error handling** (`try/except`) with meaningful error messages.
- **Keep code clean & well-documented** (type hints, docstrings, and comments where needed).
- **Optimize imports and avoid redundant code**.
- **Make sure all user configurations, settings, and optional parameters work as expected.**

⚠ **Analyze the code first to confirm that changes will not break existing functionality before making modifications.**

🔹 How to Adapt It for Other Parts of Your Project
For different areas of your plugin, tweak specific constraints like:

For command handling → Ensure it doesn’t change how commands are parsed or executed.
For async handling → Make sure background tasks and event loops remain stable.
For personality systems → Ensure responses remain formatted correctly without unintended changes.
This framework ensures Claude won’t wreck your work
