# Rick Assistant Powerlevel10k Integration Instructions
# Follow these steps to update your .zshrc file for proper integration

## STEP 1: Add Integration Files to .zshrc
# Add these lines AFTER the line that sources .p10k.zsh:

# Load Rick Assistant Powerlevel10k integration
[[ -f ~/.rick-wsl-fix.zsh ]] && source ~/.rick-wsl-fix.zsh
[[ -f ~/.rick-distro-detect.zsh ]] && source ~/.rick-distro-detect.zsh
[[ -f ~/.rick-p10k-integration.zsh ]] && source ~/.rick-p10k-integration.zsh

## STEP 2: Remove Any Old Integration Code
# Comment out or remove any previous Rick Assistant Powerlevel10k integration lines like:
# source "$ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/rick_assistant/src/core/integrations/p10k_integration.zsh"
# source "$ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/rick_assistant/src/core/integrations/p10k_init.zsh"

## STEP 3: Make Sure Instant Prompt Configuration is Consistent
# You should have only ONE of these settings:
typeset -g POWERLEVEL9K_INSTANT_PROMPT=quiet
# OR
# export POWERLEVEL9K_INSTANT_PROMPT=off

## STEP 4: Optional Debug Mode
# Uncomment this line if you want to enable debug output:
# export RICK_P10K_DEBUG=true

## STEP 5: Apply Changes
# After making these changes, restart your shell:
# exec zsh

## Troubleshooting
# If you encounter issues:
# 1. Run the diagnostics script:
#    source ~/.rick-p10k-diagnostics.zsh
# 2. Make sure you run p10k configure to create a clean configuration:
#    p10k configure
# 3. Ensure all the scripts are executable:
#    chmod +x ~/.rick-*.zsh
